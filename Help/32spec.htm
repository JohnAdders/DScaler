<h1>Mark Rejhon's 3:2 Pulldown Alogrithm</h1>

<p>Here's a simplified pseudocode implementation of <a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/000071.html" target=
"_blank">my 3:2 pulldown detection algorithm</a>. You might even
easily be able to implement this into DScaler. Almost all of us
really don't care about 2:2 pulldown at all as I only see this
happening only 0.1 to 0.5% of the time on NTSC television.
Without further ado, here you go!</p>

<p><b>OPTIONAL: BETTER SYNCHRONIZATION TO MONITOR REFRESH</b></p>

<p>It is desirable to make the output refresh independent of the
input refresh for better synchronization. During 3/2 pulldown
material, it is very desirable to synchronize to the monitor
refresh instead of the input TV signal refresh. During watching
in normal TV viewers, 3/2 pulldown is doubled to 6/4 pulldown
when the refresh rate is doubled to 120 Hz. It would be very nice
to have something closer to 5/5 pulldown when watching movie
material instead of 6/4 pulldown.</p>

<p>In the pseudocode above in the last section,<br>
There are 24 frames per second in OUTPUT queue in MOVIE mode<br>
There are 60 frames per second in OUTPUT queue in VIDEO mode</p>

<p>You can synchronize the OUTPUT queue of fields to the monitor
refresh, based on the value in the FRAMES_PER_SECOND variable. By
keeping a small output buffer of frames (of about 2 or so frames)
you can keep the pipeline of output frames flowing smoothly and
synchronized much better to the computer monitor.</p>

<p>Also, since the computer clock is accurate, this can help
"stabilize" unstable NTSC refresh such as those from a VCR which
can sometimes have slightly-varying refresh rates (fluctuating
randomly as low as 59Hz all the way up to 61Hz although usually
by smaller increments). This can interact badly with a consistent
computer refresh. Regular TV sets have a very slight amount of
"give" that allows it to compensate for very minor fluctuations
in refresh rate, but computer monitors won't compensate.</p>

<p>It can also smooth out jerkiness problems caused by
fluctuating CPU usage on a frame-by-frame basis, since
deinterlacing one pair of frames might take longer than
deinterlacing a different pair of frames (using certain video
source deinterlacing algorithms).</p>

<p>There is also the problem of compensating for drift when the
output framerate is decoupled from the refresh of the input
signal. There are two good possible ways of getting around this
drift problem:</p>

<p>(1) AVOID displaying the output frame if there is less than 2
frames in the OUTPUT queue, and ACCELERATE displaying of the next
frame if the number of frames in the OUTPUT queue exceeds a
predetermined value such as 4. That way, you always keep 2, 3 or
4 frames buffered at all times for maximum fluidity. (You could
experiment, and set the minimum to 1 and maximum to 3, to find
out which produces the best fluidity at the minimum possible
buffering. Too much buffering will cause audio to be noticeably
lagged behind the video)</p>

<p>(2) Synchronize to a clock that's generated from the TV tuner
card, instead of using the computer's clock. For example,
increment an integer clock counter by 1 everytime a field arrives
from the TV card. This clock would be incremented about 59.94
times per second for most NTSC signals. Keep an eye on the
computer's clock everytime you increment the integer clock by 60
- to calculate the exact amount of time it takes for 60 fields to
hit the TV tuner card. Do this continously every second. Divide
this value by 24 to compute the amount of time there should be
between frames, during MOVIE mode, during the next second. (If
you prefer, you could use 5 second cycles instead of 1 second
cycles, or keep a "rolling average" every field based on the
previous X number of fields).</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><b>APPENDIX: PSEUDOCODE WITHOUT COMMENTS</b></p>

<p>For determining the amount of "code bulk", this is how small
the pseudocode is, when I remove my comments from the above
pseudocode. Look at how small the pseudocode is - since you
already have the routines written in DScaler, look at how simple
it is to implement automatic 3:2 pulldown deinterlacing!</p>
