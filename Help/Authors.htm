      <h2>John Adcock</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>John is the founder and maintainer of the project. He did huge amounts of full time 
          development on versions 
          1.0 through 1.6 Beta 4. He did most of the work cleaning, translating 
          and legalizing Multidec. He put into code, the world's first open-source 
          real-time 3:2 pulldown software deinterlacer (based on Mark Rejhon's 
          algorithm article). He also designed an open-source video-material deinterlacer 
          that is superior to those in virtually any other any PC-based video 
          software product.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Mark Rejhon</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 
          Mark authored the 3:2 pulldown algorithm that forms the basis of the 
          algorithm implemented into DScaler by John Adcock. He also does other programming 
          tasks like code cleanup, merging, documenting, testing, enhancing of 
          contributors' changes that are submitted to the project. He also enhances
          DScaler with his own changes to certain parts of the code, including improvements 
          to the deinterlacer modes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Steve Grimm</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Steve is contributing enhancements to the deinterlacing modes including 
          better automatic switching between video mode and 3:2 pulldown mode, 
          and handling of material that has bad 3:2 pulldown. In particular, Steve 
          made significant modifications to the deinterlacing algorithm in version 
          2.0.0. He also worked on an early version of a 3:2 pulldown deinterlacing 
          algorithm. In addition, he is the author of the aspect ratio autodetection 
          code which was included in version 1.9.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Tom Barry</h2>
      <blockquote>Tom contributed the triple buffering code and synchronization 
        fixes for version 2.0.0. Also, he has authored several MMX assembly optimizations 
        to the video deinterlace mode and added the advanced Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset settings menu, both of which were included in version 1.9.</blockquote>
      <h2>Michael Samblanet</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Michael is continuing to upgrade his aspect ratio control code.<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Michael Eskin </h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>An engineer working at Conexant Systems Inc., the makers of the 8x8
        series chips that DScaler runs on.&nbsp; He basically meditates peace
        between the DScaler software and the 8x8 video capture hardware.&nbsp; When
        any of us fails on a nasty 8x8 issue, he takes over and gets the job
        done from time to time.&nbsp; One of his several valuable contributions
        include a bug fix to make Macrovision-encoded sources watchable in DScaler,
        without purple-lines interference.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Laurent Garnier</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Despite having really no link with the French DJ, he's the latest one 
          on the DScaler boat. He coded the auto detection of WSS 
          (WideScreen Signalling), improved the OSD with various &quot;status 
          screens&quot;. He also did the popup menu, per-format settings persistency. 
          He's the second European coder, along with John Adcock.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Torbjörn Jansson</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Added the new generic settings dialog and has provided many bug fixes</p>
      </blockquote>

        list of the many others who have contributed time and effort.</p>
