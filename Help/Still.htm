      <p>DScaler is now able to produce a video stream from a still file. This 
        type of source is not interlaced, so the deinterlace mode is irrelevant 
        for this type of source, but you can use all the available filters as 
        you do for all other video sources.</p>
      <p>They are three different still sources in DScaler, and a virtual playlist 
        (a playlist not necessarily attached to a file) is associated to each 
        of them :</p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Still : contains all the still files opened by the user</li>
        <li>Patterns : contains all the pre-defined test patterns</li>
        <li>Snapshots : contains all the stills taken during the current DScaler 
          session</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each time the current DScaler source is one of these still sources, the 
        menu &quot;Playlist&quot; is available in the menubar.</p>
      <p> 
      <font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Displaying a still</b></font> 
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DScaler can be used to display stills directly in the graphic card overlay. 
        DScaler supports most of JPEG and TIFF files.</p>
      <p>A DScaler new file format has been created too. It is used to describe 
        test patterns. The test pattern is generated in the graphic card overlay 
        according to its description when this file is opened in DScaler.</p>
      <p>To open a new still file, select the item &quot;Open...&quot; in the 
        menu &quot;File&quot;. The selected file, if supported by DScaler, will 
        be added to the virtual playlist associated to the &quot;Still&quot; source 
        and will be displayed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Taking a still</b></font> </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DScaler can be used to take a still of what is currently displayed by 
        DScaler.</p>
      <p>To take a still, select the item &quot;Take Still Picture&quot; in the 
        menu &quot;View&quot;, or use the &quot;L&quot; shortcut.</p>
      <p>When you take a still, a file is automatically created in the DScaler 
        main directory or in the directory you specified in your settings. The 
        following rule is applied to define the file name :<br>
        TV&lt;yyyy&gt;&lt;mm&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;hh&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&lt;ss&gt;&lt;cc&gt;.&lt;ext&gt; 
        where :<br>
        &lt;yyyy&gt; is the current year, &lt;mm&gt; is the current month, &lt;dd&gt; 
        is the current day<br>
        &lt;hh&gt; is the current hour, &lt;mi&gt; is the current minute, &lt;ss&gt; 
        is the current second<br>
        &lt;cc&gt; is a counter between 00 and 99 allowing 100 captures in the 
        same second<br>
        &lt;ext&gt; is tif or jpg</p>
      <p>You have a direct access to all the stills taken during the current DScaler 
        session as they are all grouped in a virtual playlist. Select the &quot;Snapshots&quot; 
        source in the menu &quot;Sources&quot; to have a direct access to these 
        stills. When switching to the &quot;Snapshots&quot; source, the displayed 
        still will be the last still taken during the session.</p>
      <p>You can choose between different file formats when taking a still :</p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>TIFF with RGB colourspace : a conversion from YCbCr colourspace to 
          RGB colourspace is applied but no compression</li>
        <li>TIFF with YCbCr colourspace : no colorspace conversion neither compression 
          is applied</li>
        <li>JPEG : a JPEG compression is applied</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><u>Warning</u>: in one side, the format TIFF YCbCr is the best as it 
        takes a perfect copy of what is in the overlay and you can restore exactly 
        the same content later; in another side, this format is not supported 
        by lots of graphic software. So this format has to be avoided if you want 
        to share this file with other people.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The following settings can be adjusted; they are all defined in the section 
        &quot;Still&quot; of the ini file.</p>

            higher is the picture quality and bigger is the file size.</td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Arial" size="3"><b><font face="Arial">Playlists</font></b></font></p>
      <p>DScaler allows to load and define playlists. A playlist is a set of still 
        files defined in a text file with the extension &quot;.d3u&quot;. Each 
        line of such a file defines the path to a file which has to be a supported 
        still file in order to be readable by DScaler.</p>
      <p>To open a new playlist file, select the item &quot;Open...&quot; in the 
        menu &quot;File&quot;. All the files contained in the selected playlist 
        file will be added to the virtual playlist associated to the &quot;Still&quot; 
        source, and the first file of the loaded playlist will be displayed.</p>
      <p>To create and save a new playlist, you can either create manually the 
        playlist file with a text editor, either load all the files you want to 
        include in the new playlist and then save the current virtual playlist 
        as a playlist file. To save the current virtual playlist as a playlist 
        file, select the item &quot;Save As ...&quot; in the menu &quot;Playlist&quot;.</p>
      <p>The menu &quot;Playlist&quot; allows to navigate through the different 
        files of the current virtual playlist : &quot;Previous&quot;, &quot;Next&quot;, 
        &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Last&quot; allows to jump to the previous, 
        the next, the first or the last file in the playlist. The sub-menu &quot;Files&quot; 
        gives a direct access to all the files in the playlist. Items which are 
        greyed in this sub-menu are files that DScaler is not able to read.</p>
      <p>The menu &quot;Playlist&quot; allows to change the order of files in 
        the virtual playlist : &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; allows to shift 
        up or down in the playlist the current displayed file.</p>
      <p>To close the current displayed file and suppress it from the virtual 
        playlist, select the item &quot;Close&quot; in the menu &quot;Playlist&quot;. 
        You can even close all the files of the virtual playlist by selecting 
        the item &quot;Close All&quot; in the same menu.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Slide show</b></font></p>
      <p>When the current virtual playlist contains several stills, it is possible 
        to launch a slide show. You have only to select the item &quot;Slideshow&quot; 
        in the menu &quot;Playlist&quot;. A cyclic slide show will then be executed 
        through all the files in the playlist, starting from the current displayed 
        file. You can stop the slide show at any time by selecting again the item 
        &quot;Slideshow&quot;.</p>
      <p>The following setting can be adjusted; it is defined in the section &quot;Still&quot; 
        of the ini file.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Test patterns</b></font> 
      <p></p>
      <p>DScaler includes now a pattern generator. Each test pattern can be described 
        in a text file with the extension &quot;.pat&quot;. This description follows 
        a certain syntax. When opening one of these files, DScaler automatically 
        builds the picture corresponding to the description and display it in 
        the graphic card overlay exactly as if it was a normal still file.</p>
      <p>The role of this pattern generator is to create patterns which can be 
        displayed directly in the graphic card overlay and be used by the user 
        to adjust overlay and monitor settings. Of course, this generator cannot 
        do everything. It is for example restricted to static pictures and to 
        rectangular shapes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DScaler is delivered with few pre-defined test patterns allowing to adjust 
        contrast, brightness, color, gamma, ... You have a direct access to all 
        these pre-defined test patterns as they are all grouped in a virtual playlist. 
        Select the &quot;Patterns&quot; source in the menu &quot;Sources&quot; 
        to have a direct access to these test patterns.</p>
      <p>You can define your own test patterns. You have only to follow the right 
        syntax and save your text in a file with an extension &quot;.pat&quot;. 
        When this is done, open your file in DScaler.</p>
      <p>The size of each test pattern is not defined in the file describing the 
        pattern but is a global DScaler setting for all the test patterns. You 
        can adjust this setting which is defined in the section &quot;Patternl&quot; 
        of the ini file.</p>
